        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          While education can be a foundation for equality and better employment opportunities, access is not equitable. Education justice is crucial for fostering equal opportunities and a fair, inclusive society. It emphasizes ensuring that every individual, regardless of background, has access to high-quality education and necessary resources for success, impacting both the present and future generations.
        </p>
        <p>
          As students of Johns Hopkins, we wanted to analyze the status of education justice in the United States.
          We were motivated in part by the Supreme Court's affirmative action decision during the summer, indicating that institutions of higher education can no longer consider race as a specific criterion in their admission processes.
        </p>
      </section>
      
      <section id="key-indicators">
        <h2>I. Key Indicators of Education Justice</h2>
        <h3>What are the key indicators of education justice?</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Access to quality education.</li>
          <li>Inclusive curriculum.</li>
          <li>Beginning age of education.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          In this analysis, we will mostly consider the problem of access to quality education.
          First, we need to consider pre-college education.
        </p>
        
        <h3>I.A Relationship between GPA tier and parental income</h3>
        <p>One indicator for academic access before college is GPA & School Ranks.</p>
        <h4>Before exploring the interactive graph, consider the relationship between GPA distributions and parental income.</h4>
        <p>Choose different income levels in the graph below to observe the corresponding GPA distributions or click on the GPA summary plot for an overview.</p>
        <div class="graph-container">
          <center>
            <iframe src="html/gpa_vs_parental_income_interactive.html"></iframe>
            <a href="html/gpa_vs_parental_income_static.html" class="rectangle-button">GPA summary plot</a>
          </center>
        </div>
        <p>As parental income levels rise, so do GPA's. Given the crucial role of GPA in college admissions, this correlation raises concerns about potential education injustices.</p>
        
        <h3>I.B Relationship between high school ranks and parental income</h3>
        <h4>Before exploring the next interactive graph, consider the potential relationship between high school ranks and parental income.</h4>
        <p>Click through different income levels to observe how high school ranks correspond. For a comprehensive view, check out the summary plot.</p>
        <div class="graph-container">
          <center>
            <iframe src="html/high_school_ranks_vs_parental_income_interactive.html"></iframe>
            <a href="html/high_school_ranks_vs_parental_income_static.html" class="rectangle-button">High School Ranks summary plot</a>
          </center>
        </div>
        <p>Clearly, increases in parental income aligns with higher high school ranks, sparking considerations about potential disparities in education.</p>
        <p>These are just a couple of many indicators of education injustice.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="analysis">
        <h2>II. University Attendance vs. Parental Income</h2>
        <p>
          Based on our initial indicators, we used the Opportunity Insights College Admissions Dataset to explore nuances in higher education access.

        <h3>II.A Absolute Attendance Rate</h3>

        </div>
        <p>
          The graph that the anticipated linear correlation in the data does not hold true. Instead, the graph displays peaks on the ends, indicating that colleges prioritize different values in their admissions criteria. This can be explained by the different situations for either extremes, individuals from wealthier backgrounds exhibit a higher enrollment percentage since they are able to afford to pay full tuition and those in lower brackets who may not be financially able often receive a favorable aid plan. However, individuals in the middle-income range receive minimal tuition assistance, although they lack the means to pay for their education in full. The right side of the graph appears more sparse, emphasizing the difference between public and private schools in these particular brackets. Public schools emerge as significant players, as they can offer more academic scholarships, influencing the decision-making process for prospective attendees of varing financial backgrounds. While the groups generally exhibit similar trends, specific examples, such as Harvard, stand out, highlighting the impact of individual school policies on admissions. This emphasizes the importance of considering unique institutional factors when interpreting broader trends in college admissions.

        <p>
          This graph indicates a linear correlation with income, aligning with the expected trend. Schools demonstrate a cohesive flow, with the trend being more pronounced in higher-ranking institutions. However, there is a noticeable difference in absolute attendance rates across income levels within a college. The explanation for this difference can be explained by different financial situations. For example, an individuals from lower-income backgrounds is admitted, they may be less inclined to attend due to higher cost of tuition and may likely favor other more affordable options. This suggests that economic considerations play a significant role in shaping attendance choices, even when admissions policies accommodate lower-income individuals.

        <p>
          The graph illustrates a trend with peaks at the ends, indicating higher acceptance rates than students applying. While the ideal scenario would be an even ratio of acceptance rates across all income brackets, it is crucial to ensure that the volume of applications from each bracket is also similar. Unfortunately, the current graph does not provide information on the volume of applications in each income bracket, making it challenging to assess the overall equity and fairness in the college admissions process. To comprehensively evaluate the situation, a more detailed analysis of application volumes across income brackets would be necessary.

        <h4>
          Students with high-income parents are largely responsible for dramatic increases in unweighted relative application rates. Use the slider at the top of the section to differentiate between these high-income groups.
        </h4>
        <p>
          The analysis reveals a linear relationship, particularly prominent in more selective and higher-ranked schools. Better schools show a stronger correlation with this trend. However, the cost associated with sending in applications might affect students in lower-income brackets, leading them to apply to fewer schools and potentially limiting their in the selection of where to apply and the risk they're willing to take when applying to selective schools. The ability to visit schools and tours may also influence application rates, resulting in higher values in the higher income brackets, likely due to travel expenses of such visits. Additionally, the support provided by college counselors in the application process appears to be more prevalent in better-funded schools. Moreover, colleges may allocate fewer admissions resources to lesser-funded schools. Consequently, students from these schools might have limited exposure to information about various colleges, potentially impacting their knowledge and understanding of the available options.

          <p>
            The unweighted chart shows high attendance rates for students from the highest income brackets, especially the Top 1 and 0.1% and for Ivy Plus schools. The contrast between the highest parental income and other brackets is very pronounced, suggesting that students from wealthier families are attending universities at a much higher rate.
          </p>
          <p>
            What are some reasons for this? We can re-weight the attendance rates by test score and see how that changes attendance rates.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some tiers, like Ivy Plus, see a smoothing out of the distribution, though the higher parental income percentiles still achieve higher attendance rates. This means that while these universities might have made the acceptance rate more equitable between groups, there are still other factors besides test scores that contribute towards the differences we see.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, students from higher income families likely have the time and resources to invest into extracurriculars, which are taken into account by college admissions boards. Moreover, these students may have access to college counselors to help with the admission process.
